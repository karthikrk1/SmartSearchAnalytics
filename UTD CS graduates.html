  <h1>Welcome to The University of Texas at Dallas. The Department of Computer Science</h1>
  </h1><b>About our department graduates</b></h1>
	<p>Our Graduates are highly regarded for their deep technical knowledge, our graduates are sought after by major software and telecom companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Ericsson, VMware and RIM. Our PhD graduates are well-prepared to take on research and teaching positions. We are located in the middle of the Dallas areaâ€™s high-tech hub, surrounded by hundreds of software, hardware and telecom companies. Not only do these companies hire our students in large numbers as interns (more than 400 last year) and full-time employees (nearly 100% of our graduates had found positions by graduation last year), but they work with our faculty and students on joint research projects too. We have also taken steps to encourage entrepreneurship among our students by introducing entrepreneurship education into our programs. Many of our graduates have founded successful companies.</p>
