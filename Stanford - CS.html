        <h1> Welcome to Stanford University - Computer Science</h1>
        <p>The Stanford Computer Science Department was founded in 1965.  A half-century on, the department is a force for innovation, 
            scientific discovery and world-wide impact.  
            We are particularly proud of the graduates of our programs, many of whom are leaders in academia, industry and government. 
            Stanford's Christopher RÃ©, an assistant professor of computer science, has been awarded a "genius grant" from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He was recognized for his work in developing a data-inference system that analyzes data with a high degree of certainty.</p>
