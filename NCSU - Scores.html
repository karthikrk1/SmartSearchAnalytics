        <h1> Welcome to North Carolina State University - Scores</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p> The GRE general exam is required of all applicants. The General GRE test scores expire five years after the test date. Expired scores are not accepted.

The average GRE scores (percent scoring below) of international applicants recently admitted to graduate study in the Department are: Verbal Reasoning 64%, Quantitative Reasoning 94%, and Analytical Writing 42%. The average GRE scores of recently-admitted US applicants are: Verbal Reasoning 77%, Quantitative Reasoning 81%, and Analytical Writing 57%. All three sections of the GRE are considered when evaluating applicants.

The institution code 5496 is the only code needed to report scores to NC State University. If ETS gives you an option to report a test to NCSU undergraduate admissions, select the NCSU Graduate School instead. </p>
